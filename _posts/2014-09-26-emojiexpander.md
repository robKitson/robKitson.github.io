Unlike [Casey Liss][1], I'm all thumbs when it comes to Emoji. Probaly because I suck at them. My infrequent use causes me to forget what my options are and where they are in the 'keyboard'. And, to be honest, I find the similarity of some of the faces to be too close and not entirely representative of what I'm trying to convey.

The other day, I saw [Leveled Up Emoji][2], and realized I've been doing it wrong this whole time. I really like Casey's approach, taking the time to pick out and assemble some winners that I can mentally map to words is really going to take my Emoji-ing to the next level. I got a kick and a chuckle out of a lot of his shortcuts and was thinking some of them were great candidates to seed my own collection of Emoji shortcuts.

But I use [TextExpander][3]. So I re-created all of his shortcuts in TextExpander and have saved [the folder][4] so that, if you're a novice like me, you can import it into your TextExpander library and start your own collection.

[You can download it here.][4]

My thanks to Casey for the inspiration and the jump-start.
